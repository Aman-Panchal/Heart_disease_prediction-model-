# Heart_disease_prediction-model-
Minor Project of 3rd year
• Objective: To reduce physical interaction in covid build a model that can predict that he/she affected by heart diseases in the future.
• Used various parameters age, chest pain type, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, etc. Perform correlation and data preprocessing and data visualization.
• Used Classification algos: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. And KNN outperforms all with 87.91 accuracies. Link.


Aim Of Project :-
Our main goal is to predict whether the patient 
      is suffering  from heart disease or not.

For this project we use Heart Disease UCI dataset
      from Kaggle .

Problems :  Heart Disease a rising killer![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62400307/141045104-1d593c29-d59f-4375-ac6f-6846afab63ab.png)
In India, about 45 million people suffer from coronary artery disease.
Death rate due to cardiovascular  disease is rose by around  34% from  155.7 to 209.1 per 1lakh  from 1990 to 2016.
India has  1 doctor in 1445 patient.
According to NITI Aayog India has 6 lakh  shortfall of doctors.
In rural 70 % people live and doctors are 1/4 of urban area.
     
         India will soon bear the largest burden of heart disease globally
