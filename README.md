# Heart_disease_prediction-model-
Minor Project of 3rd year
• Objective: To reduce physical interaction in covid build a model that can predict that he/she affected by heart diseases in the future.
• Used various parameters age, chest pain type, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, etc. Perform correlation and data preprocessing and data visualization.
• Used Classification algos: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. And KNN outperforms all with 87.91 accuracies. Link.
