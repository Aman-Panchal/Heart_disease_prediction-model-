# Heart_disease_prediction-model-

Minor Project of 3rd year

• Objective: To reduce physical interaction in covid build a model that can predict that he/she affected by heart diseases in the future.

• Used various parameters age, chest pain type, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, etc. Perform correlation and data preprocessing and data visualization.

• Used Classification algos: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. And KNN outperforms all with 87.91 accuracies.

## Aim Of Project :-

-Our main goal is to predict whether the patient 
      is suffering  from heart disease or not.

-For this project we use Heart Disease UCI dataset
      from Kaggle .


## Approach to solve problem 
1. Frame the problem
2. Get the Data
3. Explore the data to gain insight
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning  algorithms 
5. Explore many different models and short list best one
6. Fine Tune the model
7. Present solution

 ## Problems :  Heart Disease a rising killer 
 
-In India, about 45 million people suffer from coronary artery disease.

-Death rate due to cardiovascular  disease is rose by around  34% from  155.7 to 209.1 per 1lakh  from 1990 to 2016.

-India has  1 doctor in 1445 patient.

-According to NITI Aayog India has 6 lakh  shortfall of doctors.

-In rural 70 % people live and doctors are 1/4 of urban area.
     
         India will soon bear the largest burden of heart disease globally

## Get the Data: The Heart Disease(UCI) dataset which we had used in our project is taken from kaggle.

| Features |
| :-------- |
| `Age` |
| `Sex` |
| `Chest pain type` |
| `Blood pressure ` |
| `Electrocardiographic(ecg) report ` |
| `Heart rate` |

## Result

|    |**Model** | **Training Accuracy %**    | **Testing Accuracy %**             |
| :- | :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| 1| `Tuned Logistic Regression` | 85.85 |  	85.71|
| 2|`Tuned K-nearest neighbors` | 81.13 |  	87.91 |
| 3|`Tuned Support Vector Machine` | 87.74 |  	84.62 |
| 4 |`Tuned Decision Tree Classifier` |  	91.51 | 76.92|


## Advantage & Disadvantage
Advantage:

-Increase availability to patient.

-Available to 14 hours and 7 week.

-Less costly.

Disadvantage:

-Not for emergency patient.


## Future Scope
1. Create a website. 

2. Then create database of doctors and patient, than suggest the contact no. is passed of nearest doctor to him.

3. Also prescript medicine to patient.
